<p>I have been avoiding news sites, mostly successfully, for a while now. Life is better without knowing about things I neither care nor can do anything about. The Economist once a week is enough. When I do accidentally dip into NYT or similar, I am reminded that the Bad Guys really are winning and it depresses me to no end.</p> <span class="permalinkHash"><a href="18/Nonewsisgoodnews.html">#</a></span>

<p>Adding social or collaborative features to an app invariably makes that app worse. (Unless of course that's what the app is <i>for</i>)</p> <span class="permalinkHash"><a href="18/Socialfeatures.html">#</a></span>

<p>I've been writing in my wiki at <a href="https://rudimentarylathe.wiki">rudimentarylathe.wiki</a> for over three years. It now contains 2766 "tiddlers". That's the longest I've stuck with any platform in as long as I can remember. I often think about moving to something newer or prettier or whatever, but in short order I'm back in TiddlyWiki. It's comfortable.</p> <span class="permalinkHash"><a href="18/ThreeyearsattheLathe.html">#</a></span>
