<p>For years, I'd tell you that typing in a native Mac app is by far the best way to write <i>anything</i>. That was when web apps were still pretty basic and terrible. Today, though, browsers are pretty good at, well, everything. I still mostly prefer native apps, but the gap has closed considerably.</p>
<p>It also depends on where the text is to end up. If it's for, say, a blog post, why not just write in a browser, since one could argue that for web publishing, editing in a browser <i>is</i> using a native app.</p> <span class="permalinkHash"><a href="06/ItsaboutwhereIliketotype.html">#</a></span>

<p>If I want a "Featured Image" on a post here, I just paste the URL in the "Image" attribute of the post and the template puts it where it belongs. I'd almost forgotten I did that. Can you imagine how great things would be if I focused my time and attention on just one or two things for months or years rather than just dipping my toes in?</p> <span class="permalinkHash"><a href="06/ImageTest.html">#</a></span>
