	<p>Have you ever been to a bookstore? I have, and they are wonderful.</p>
<p>I needed to run some errands yesterday and happened to drive by <a href="https://www.schulerbooks.com/">Schuler Books</a>, an independent store based in Michigan and one I've been going to for decades.</p>
<p>It's been a couple of years since I've been inside a bookstore and oh my goodness what a feeling. Am I the only one that feels a certain calming wonder upon entering any bookstore? Maybe not the giant chain stores because they feel a little yucky to me and it takes the fun out of it, but the local(ish) stores that have been in the neighborhood forever. Mmmm.</p>
<p>Shopping for books by walking around amongst the shelves is an immeasurably better experience than endlessly clicking on the computer. The only reviews to be had are a few hand-written notes in front of some books. One per book. No aggregated score. No algorithm. No ads.</p>
<p>I bought the <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/termination-shock-9780063028050/9780063028050">new Neal Stephenson book</a> (which is honestly why I was there in the first place). But I also bought <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-ten-thousand-doors-of-january-9780316421997/9780316421973">The Ten Thousand Doors of January</a> and a <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-selected-poetry-of-rainer-maria-rilke-bilingual-edition/9780679722014">book of poetry by Rilke</a>. During checkout, they said that they loved the Rilke book and how it included the original German-language versions. They then inserted a bookmark in each book, and packed them all into a crisp paper bag and said, "Enjoy!"</p>

<p>Bookstores are the best.</p>
