	<p>There's something happening again over in Dave's world of Drummer. It's feeling like dÃ©jÃ  vu all over again.</p>
<p>I've been mentally hedging my bets and wondering how difficult it would be to morph this Tinderbox-generated blog into something much more Drummer like. They're both based on outlines, after all. I'd just need to change the export templates to group by day and deal with individual vs titled notes. There's probably a lot more to it, but let's noodle on it, shall we?</p>
