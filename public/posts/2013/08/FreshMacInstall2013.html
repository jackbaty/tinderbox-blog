	<p>My iMac at home has been acting up. After confirming at the Apple store that it was not a hardware issue, I decided to wipe and rebuild. This is something I do occasionally, and I hate myself for it every time. I do it anyway.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of a clean start is that I get to revisit the list of apps I consider essential. The list of apps I use changes over time as I try new things but the first things I install is a good way to determine what I find necessary at the moment. </p>
<p>There are utilities that I've come to rely on. The most surprising newcomer here is PopClip. I would have guessed that I'd become annoyed seeing the PopClip menu pop up every time I selected some text, but it's so handy that I've kept it around. The usual suspects, LaunchBar, Keyboard Maestro, and TextExpander remain. I tried Alfred instead of LaunchBar for a while and it's very nice but LaunchBar is more my style. </p>
<p>As for primary apps, of course Tinderbox remains at the top of the list. It does everything related to writing, reviewing, and managing notes. Why more people I know don't use Tinderbox is beyond me. I guess I win, then. I also find TheBrain to be indispensable. There's just nothing like it for finding connections and contextual review. I use it for managing projects, people, and ideas and the connections between them.</p>
<p>The notable ommission here is DEVONthink Pro. I love it so, but Evernote has become so good at capturing information from everywhere that I've drifted to Evernote as the place to keep "stuff." DEVONthink has been <a href="../02/DigitalRecordkeeping.html">my filing cabinet</a> for a long time, but splitting where I put things between the two apps just adds overhead. I really dislike working in Evernote, so I may change my mind (again) later.</p>
<p>For photos I use Lightroom. Tried Aperture for a while but it's just so slow. Lightroom's community is larger and support is generally more readily available. I occasionally fall into Capture One as a raw converter, but the latest Lightroom does a pretty good job with the Fuji X-E1 files. Also, I'm enamored with the VSCO film filters these days, which work really well with the Raw files in Lightroom. I use Photo Mechanic to ingest, keyword, rename, and upload photos. Photo Mechanic is built for high-speed and quickly dealing with hundreds of images, so it's odd that I would use it as much as I do, considering most of the time I'm dealing with maybe 12 scanned images at a time. There's still nothing better and my hands are hardwired to it.</p>
<p>Text editing is done with BBEdit of course. I'll play with Vim occassionally because it's so great, but I don't write much code these days and that's really where Vim shines. BBEdit is better as a general text editor.</p>
<p>For tasks I've gone back to Things. I'm a long-time OmniFocus user but the recent version 2.0 beta scared me so much I ran away. Things is great and simple. </p>

<p>So as of August 1st, 2013, these are my goto apps and utilities:</p>
