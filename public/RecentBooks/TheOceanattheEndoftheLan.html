	<p>As a fan of Neil Gaimann I was excited to read his new book, "The Ocean at the End of the Lane." I'm glad I did. There was much to like  and I enjoyed it while it lasted. The problem I had was that, once finished, I wasn't sure what the book was for. It didn't really add up for me. I'd still recommend it, though.</p>
