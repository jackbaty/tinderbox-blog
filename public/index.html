	<p>If I want a "Featured Image" on a post here, I just paste the URL in the "Image" attribute of the post and the template puts it where it belongs. I'd almost forgotten I did that. Can you imagine how great things would be if I focused my time and attention on just one or two things for months or years rather than just dipping my toes in?</p>

	<p>I'd long ago abandoned <a href="http://notes.baty.net">notes.baty.net</a> as a place for this Tinderbox-rendered blog. But now that I've published it again via <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Pages</a>, I thought it should live at its old address, so here we are.</p>

	<p>One thing that attracted me to Cloudflare Pages for static site hosting is they offer built-in traffic analytics. I just enabled Web Analytics for this domain, and their message says "Changes will take effect on the next deployment." So, I'm writing this note as an excuse to deploy üòÅ</p>

	<p>I just found this site's <a href="posts/2013/02/BloggingwithTinderbox.html">Tinderbox document</a> (started in 2013) buried in a folder and thought I'd check to see if it still worked. </p>
<p>Later...</p>
<p>It does. Now what? Well, there's always the <a href="archives.html">Archive</a>.</p>

	<p>Well I don't really know what to say other than I don't plan to continue publishing this site for the moment. I have enough places to maintain. Putting this site on my "Someday/Maybe" list. Happy new year!</p>

	<h2><a href="posts/2017/11/UsingNowtopublishastatic.html">Using Now to publish a static site</a></h2>
	 <div class="post-date">Tuesday, 14 November 2017</div>
</header>
<section>

	<p>I had heard of Now (https://zeit.co) but hadn't tried it until today. It's nifty. So nifty that I'm using it to publish this site (notes.baty.net). I simply type "now" while in the directory these static files are in and it just happens. SSL included.</p>
<p>The thing that wasn't immediately obvious was that each time you deploy, a new URL is used. This means that the alias needs to be updated each time. Seemed inconvenient, and some digging revealed that putting the default alias in a now.json file does the trick. </p>
<p>So in my case, the Tinderbox "Stamp" looks like this...</p>

<code><pre>runCommand("cd /Users/jbaty/Dropbox/@Archive/@Notes/notes.baty.net/public/ \\
 && now && now alias")</pre></code>

	<h2><a href="posts/2017/11/Whatifnoonereadsthis.html">What if no one reads this?</a></h2>
	 <div class="post-date">Sunday, 12 November 2017</div>
</header>
<section>

	<p>I ask myself, "What if no one reads what I write here?" The answer is that it doesn't matter. I share my writing publically on the off chance that someone might bump into it and find it useful. More importantly, I write so that I can revisit things later. Sometimes <i>years</i> later.</p>

	<h2><a href="posts/2017/10/WhataboutEvernote.html">What about Evernote?</a></h2>
	 <div class="post-date">Friday, 3 November 2017</div>
</header>
<section>

	<p>Yes, I abandoned Evernote years ago. But what if? :)</p>
<p>I was re-reading my <a href="https://www.baty.net/2013/digital-recordkeeping/">post about Digital Recordkeeping</a> and it prompted me to reconsider using Evernote. Evernote was my "junk drawer" but I switched to putting <i>everything</i> into DEVONthink instead. This has caused my DEVONthink databases to become messy. I don't like DEVONthink to be messy, that's what Evernote was for.</p>
<p>So, I've installed Evernote again to see if it's still feasible as a junk drawer and if it helps keep DEVONthink clean.</p>
