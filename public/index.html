	<p>There's something happening again over in Dave's world of Drummer. It's feeling like d√©j√† vu all over again.</p>
<p>I've been mentally hedging my bets and wondering how difficult it would be to morph this Tinderbox-generated blog into something much more Drummer like. They're both based on outlines, after all. I'd just need to change the export templates to group by day and deal with individual vs titled notes. There's probably a lot more to it, but let's noodle on it, shall we?</p>

	<p>For years, I'd tell you that typing in a native Mac app is by far the best way to write <i>anything</i>. That was when web apps were still pretty basic and terrible. Today, though, browsers are pretty good at, well, everything. I still mostly prefer native apps, but the gap has closed considerably.</p>
<p>It also depends on where the text is to end up. If it's for, say, a blog post, why not just write in a browser, since one could argue that for web publishing, editing in a browser <i>is</i> using a native app.</p>

	<p>If I want a "Featured Image" on a post here, I just paste the URL in the "Image" attribute of the post and the template puts it where it belongs. I'd almost forgotten I did that. Can you imagine how great things would be if I focused my time and attention on just one or two things for months or years rather than just dipping my toes in?</p>

	<p>I'd long ago abandoned <a href="http://notes.baty.net">notes.baty.net</a> as a place for this Tinderbox-rendered blog. But now that I've published it again via <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Pages</a>, I thought it should live at its old address, so here we are.</p>

	<p>One thing that attracted me to Cloudflare Pages for static site hosting is they offer built-in traffic analytics. I just enabled Web Analytics for this domain, and their message says "Changes will take effect on the next deployment." So, I'm writing this note as an excuse to deploy üòÅ</p>

	<p>If I'm being honest, I'll admit that this is just an excuse to play with some <a href="https://eastgate.com/Tinderbox">old toys</a> and experiment with <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com">new ones</a>.</p>

	<p>I just found this site's <a href="posts/2013/02/BloggingwithTinderbox.html">Tinderbox document</a> (started in 2013) buried in a folder and thought I'd check to see if it still worked. </p>
<p>Later...</p>
<p>It does. Now what? Well, there's always the <a href="archives.html">Archive</a>.</p>

	<p>Well I don't really know what to say other than I don't plan to continue publishing this site for the moment. I have enough places to maintain. Putting this site on my "Someday/Maybe" list. Happy new year!</p>

	<h2><a href="posts/2017/11/UsingNowtopublishastatic.html">Using Now to publish a static site</a></h2>
	 <div class="post-date">Tuesday, 14 November 2017</div>
</header>
<section>

	<p>I had heard of Now (https://zeit.co) but hadn't tried it until today. It's nifty. So nifty that I'm using it to publish this site (notes.baty.net). I simply type "now" while in the directory these static files are in and it just happens. SSL included.</p>
<p>The thing that wasn't immediately obvious was that each time you deploy, a new URL is used. This means that the alias needs to be updated each time. Seemed inconvenient, and some digging revealed that putting the default alias in a now.json file does the trick. </p>
<p>So in my case, the Tinderbox "Stamp" looks like this...</p>

<code><pre>runCommand("cd /Users/jbaty/Dropbox/@Archive/@Notes/notes.baty.net/public/ \\
 && now && now alias")</pre></code>
