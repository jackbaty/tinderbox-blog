<title>And what if it worked the same way? For example, this post has no title. I wrote up some notes.</title>

<title>What if I built Drummer out of Tinderbox?</title>
<link>https://notes.baty.net/posts/2021/11/WednesdayNovember172021/WhatifIbuiltDrummeroutof.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>I've been mentally hedging my bets around <a href="http://drummer.scripting.com">Drummer</a> and wondering how difficult it would be to morph this Tinderbox-generated blog into something much more Drummer like. They're both based on outlines, after all. I'd just need to change the export templates to group by day and deal with individual vs titled notes. There's probably a lot more to it, but let's noodle on it, shall we?</p>

<p>:2 hours later:</p>

<p>I did it. You're soaking in it. I <a href="  https://rudimentarylathe.wiki/#Tinderbox%20Drummer%20blog">wrote up some notes in the wiki</a>.</p>

<title>It's about where I like to type</title>
<link>https://notes.baty.net/posts/2021/11/SaturdayNovember62021/ItsaboutwhereIliketotype.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>For years, I'd tell you that typing in a native Mac app is by far the best way to write <i>anything</i>. That was when web apps were still pretty basic and terrible. Today, though, browsers are pretty good at, well, everything. I still mostly prefer native apps, but the gap has closed considerably.</p>
<p>It also depends on where the text is to end up. If it's for, say, a blog post, why not just write in a browser, since one could argue that for web publishing, editing in a browser <i>is</i> using a native app.</p>

<title>Image Test</title>
<link>https://notes.baty.net/posts/2021/11/SaturdayNovember62021/ImageTest.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>If I want a "Featured Image" on a post here, I just paste the URL in the "Image" attribute of the post and the template puts it where it belongs. I'd almost forgotten I did that. Can you imagine how great things would be if I focused my time and attention on just one or two things for months or years rather than just dipping my toes in?</p>

<p>I'd long ago abandoned <a href="http://notes.baty.net">notes.baty.net</a> as a place for this Tinderbox-rendered blog. But now that I've published it again via <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Pages</a>, I thought it should live at its old address, so here we are.</p>

<title>Cloudflare web analytics</title>
<link>https://notes.baty.net/posts/2021/11/ThursdayNovember42021/Cloudflarewebanalytics.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>One thing that attracted me to Cloudflare Pages for static site hosting is they offer built-in traffic analytics. I just enabled Web Analytics for this domain, and their message says "Changes will take effect on the next deployment." So, I'm writing this note as an excuse to deploy üòÅ</p>

<title>Welcome back, I guess</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>If I'm being honest, I'll admit that this is just an excuse to play with some <a href="https://eastgate.com/Tinderbox">old toys</a> and experiment with <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com">new ones</a>.</p>
