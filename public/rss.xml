<title>I don't worry too much about "Lock-In"</title>
<link>https://notes.baty.net/posts/2021/11/14/IdontworrytoomuchaboutLo.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://youneedastereo.com/#Ton%20Zijlstra%20is%20careful%20about%20using%20notetaking%20app%20features">Phil asks</a>:</p>
		<blockquote>In short, are the short-term gains from using whatever fancy, proprietary features in a tool worth the cost of spending time worrying about lock-in, and the lost time or lost search results when you can't query all of your notes at once?‚Ä®</blockquote>
<p>Again, I think this comes down to how and when the notes are most useful. For things like my Daybook, I'm convinced that simple text files (<a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a>, in my case) are best. They're mostly for searching later. Sometimes <i>much</i> later. No other features are necessary to get value from my notes.</p>
<p>But for, say, notes about an active project, features such as transclusion and backlinking and spatial presentation can be very useful and totally worth the trade-off of (maybe) being "broken" some day in the future. I have notes from many defunct apps that can still search in a pinch. Voodoopad, Circus Ponies, etc. I just made sure to export them as best I could when it became obvious the software was going away. Spotlight almost always finds what I was looking for. It's not ideal, but it's not a big problem, either. Sure, I lost the fancy bits in translation, but I no longer need those features for those notes. As long as the fancy stuff is just layered over extractable plain text, it's probably never going to be an issue. Stop wasting time hand-wringing and get on with it, I say üòÅ.</p>
<p>What about my "Second Brain" or "Digital Garden" or "Zettelkastan" or whatever the Productivity Bloggers are labeling their random pile of notes these days? This falls somewhere between needing to be useful now and remaining useful forever, so it muddies things a little. I'm convinced that if one is trying to (lord help me) "synthesize knowledge" from their notes, the extra organization or presentation features are in every way superior <b>today</b> to a wall of plain text notes. Why not take advantage of it all?</p>
<p>(Of course, I use plain text Org files for nearly all my personal notes, but that's not because I fear lock-in. It's because I love Org mode so much.)</p>

<title>This has no title</title>

<p>And what if it worked the same way? For example, this post has no title. I <a href="  https://rudimentarylathe.wiki/#Tinderbox%20Drummer%20blog">wrote up some notes</a>.</p>

<title>What if I built Drummer out of Tinderbox?</title>
<link>https://notes.baty.net/posts/2021/11/17/WhatifIbuiltDrummeroutof.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>I've been mentally hedging my bets around <a href="http://drummer.scripting.com">Drummer</a> and wondering how difficult it would be to morph this Tinderbox-generated blog into something much more Drummer like. They're both based on outlines, after all. I'd just need to change the export templates to group by day and deal with individual vs titled notes. There's probably a lot more to it, but let's noodle on it, shall we?</p>

<p>:2 hours later:</p>

<p>I did it. You're soaking in it. I <a href="  https://rudimentarylathe.wiki/#Tinderbox%20Drummer%20blog">wrote up some notes in the wiki</a>.</p>

<title>It's about where I like to type</title>
<link>https://notes.baty.net/posts/2021/11/06/ItsaboutwhereIliketotype.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>For years, I'd tell you that typing in a native Mac app is by far the best way to write <i>anything</i>. That was when web apps were still pretty basic and terrible. Today, though, browsers are pretty good at, well, everything. I still mostly prefer native apps, but the gap has closed considerably.</p>
<p>It also depends on where the text is to end up. If it's for, say, a blog post, why not just write in a browser, since one could argue that for web publishing, editing in a browser <i>is</i> using a native app.</p>

<title>Image Test</title>
<link>https://notes.baty.net/posts/2021/11/06/ImageTest.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>If I want a "Featured Image" on a post here, I just paste the URL in the "Image" attribute of the post and the template puts it where it belongs. I'd almost forgotten I did that. Can you imagine how great things would be if I focused my time and attention on just one or two things for months or years rather than just dipping my toes in?</p>

<p>I'd long ago abandoned <a href="http://notes.baty.net">notes.baty.net</a> as a place for this Tinderbox-rendered blog. But now that I've published it again via <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Pages</a>, I thought it should live at its old address, so here we are.</p>

<title>Cloudflare web analytics</title>
<link>https://notes.baty.net/posts/2021/11/04/Cloudflarewebanalytics.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>One thing that attracted me to Cloudflare Pages for static site hosting is they offer built-in traffic analytics. I just enabled Web Analytics for this domain, and their message says "Changes will take effect on the next deployment." So, I'm writing this note as an excuse to deploy üòÅ</p>

<title>Welcome back, I guess</title>
<link>https://notes.baty.net/posts/2021/11/04/WelcomebackIguess.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<p>If I'm being honest, I'll admit that this is just an excuse to play with some <a href="https://eastgate.com/Tinderbox">old toys</a> and experiment with <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com">new ones</a>.</p>
